It should start, output some config messages and begin to search for GPS satellites.

Given 30-60 seconds, a lock should be found and useful data will appear.


This is the Arduino Mega Fork, A version with newSoftSerial is being worked on!

With that in mind, the GPS TX is connected to RX1 on the board and the GPS RX is connected to TX1 on the board.
